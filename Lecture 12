## More on strings
Now we will se what happens if we use multiplication operator with string.
s='good'
print(s*5)                                       goodgoodgoodgoodgood
print(s[0]*5)                                    ggggg
It print 5 times one after the other, which means it is like an concatenation
this tupe of data features on a string is replication, where the string 
its replicates one after the other
## String comparison
x='Hello world' 
print(x == 'Hello world')                        True              
print(x == 'hello world')                        False
It is string comparison, why is it True and why is it False because the 
string is match or not match in a print statement so it is false or true 
by compare them
print('apple'>'one')                             False
print('four'<'ten')                              True
A computer start comparison process process character as in the zeroth 
letter of first string which is a in case will be compared against zeroth 
letter of second string, this means computer will compare wheather a is
not greater than o, because of that it results into False.
