## More on strings
Now we will se what happens if we use multiplication operator with string.
s='good'
print(s*5)                                       goodgoodgoodgoodgood
print(s[0]*5)                                    ggggg
It print 5 times one after the other, which means it is like an concatenation
this tupe of data features on a string is replication, where the string 
its replicates one after the other
## String comparison
x='Hello world' 
print(x == 'Hello world')                        True              
print(x == 'hello world')                        False
It is string comparison, why is it True and why is it False because the 
string is match or not match in a print statement so it is false or true 
by compare them
print('apple'>'one')                             False
print('four'<'ten')                              True
A computer start comparison process process character as in the zeroth 
letter of first string which is a in case will be compared against zeroth 
letter of second string, this means computer will compare wheather a is
not greater than o, because of that it results into False. 
similarly in second case compare with the zeroth letter of both strings 
'four' and 'ten', the letter f is less than t because the letter f comes
before t then the output is True.
print('ab'<'az')                            True
print('abcdef'<'abcde')                     False
In first print statement, first character a is equal in both strings computer 
moves to the next character b comes before z in alphabetically order is says TRUE.
# String Indexing
s='python'
print(s[-1])                                n
print(s[-2])                                o
print(s[-3])                                h
print(s[-4])                                t
print(s[-5])                                y
print(s[-6])                                p                         
we know first letter is in zeroth index, second is in first index and so on.
what will happen indexing in negative indexing?
In negative indexing the output is all the character in a reverse order,
which means whwnever do print(s[-1]) it access the last letter of the string,
minus 2 is second last letter,minus 3 is third letter from the end and so on
is called negative indexing.
s='gdbckuksgcscyjgbchiydwgiuk'
print(s[100])                                      error
It shows an error which says string index out of range, which means we are trying
to access 100th character in the particular string but as per error it says index
out of range, which 100th character does not access in particular string.
# Find the number of character ina a particular sring
s='gdukgwvyhfvouulahduoqfdi'
print(len(s))                                       24
print(s[24])                                        error 
why Error, Error because indexing start with 0 so we will go to only at most 23 index.
