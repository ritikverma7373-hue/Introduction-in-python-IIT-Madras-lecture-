## Variables: A programmer's respective
ram_bank_balance=100000
# ram's bank balance, note that this is positive(+) .this is the first line which is commented.
ram_bank_loan=500000
# ram_bank_loan, this is to be returned by him and hence will count as negative(-).
lakshaman_bank_balance=2000000
lakshman_loan=1000000
net_income=ram_bank_balance+lakshman_bank_balance 
# net_income is the total bank balance of two brothers(ram and lakshman)
net_liablity=ram_loan+lakshman_loan
# net_liablity is the total loan of the brothers
final_value=net_income+net_liablity
# final_value is the final money of the two brothers, could be positive(+) or negative(-) 
print("So the family has",final_value)

# So is it easy on your mind when I say, when I give the variable like this 
 than say A, B, C, D. Tip number 1; try to make your variables self-explanatory.
 Second tip is add comments.How do you add comments? You add comments by
putting a (hash) followed by whatever you type here is to be ignored by the computer.
Especially if code will goes to 1000S of lines  we are bound to forget despite our being
Commment is only for you, for your purpose, just to ensure that if you seeit after few days,
few weeks,few months or sometimes even years,a software engineer writes 
a piece of code running into several 1000s of lines and someone else take a look at it.
It must make a sense only if you have take care of the variables made it very sort of human
friendly,reader friendly, programmer friendly.secondly you have a lots of commments.
