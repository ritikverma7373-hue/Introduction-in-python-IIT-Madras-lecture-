## Intoduction of python
# we tried making you warm up for programming and please note the things are not simple as appeared to 
week1(lecture1-lecture 12), things are going to more complex and that is the reason why we use the computer.
programming is all about doing complex things.
# Variables, It may sound like Greek for you,if you are listening it for the first time,but you will get use to
it.We keep buckets in our house to store entries and we have different kinds of buckets, different type of jars.
the vessel you use to store milk is not used to store let us say, plain rice.But stricky speaking certain things 
can be put in certain objects only.very similarly when a computer has different kinds of baskets for different 
kinds of enteries.If you want to store an integer, computer store in a different way;if it is a floating number or
let us say Real number, it is store in a different way.If it is a string ,the computer store in a different way.
we are going to introduce you all to what is variables, in layman's language is a basket as a real life, thanks 
to Python are very, very simple as compared to 90's and 80's.
Here, Python gives you to flexibility to declare these baskets easily.
We will starting with variables and we will go ahead with some print statement, some advanced ideas, which I think
is important for you to learn and after that, we will be moving ahead to the if loop conditional statement, there 
is this triangle which I want you all to remember. the triange is one point being is if, the other being for and 
other being while.These are simple word in english,but in programming,they mean something else and you really need
to know where you use if and and how would you use for, how do you use while. Maybe confusing at this movement,but
then please bear with me with time,you will realize what is that.
