## Operational operator:
There are many type of operator +,+,-,/,// etc.
n=3+2
print(n)                                 5

print(n)                                error                       

# Its throws an error obviously because it does not know 
how to multiply these two strings a and b the computer does
not understand how to mutiply and divide and subtract two strings.

a = 'Ritik'

n = a+b

# It simply mixes two strings, mixes as in puts it one next to other, 
this is called concatenation in englishand more so in computer science 
this is often used, they called it concatenate,put two words together 
one next to the other
a=[1,2,3]
b=[4,5,6]
n=a+b
print(n)                                [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# In a+b a and b list together
a=11
b=5
n=a/b
print(a/b)                             2.2
# The output is a floating point 2.2
n=10+12*8
print(n)                                       106
# My guess is n will be 176 but the answer is 106 why 
because whenever you have a plus and a multiplication,give priority
to multiplication, which means come immediately to the place where 
the into , the star and  multiply these two numbers, you get 96 and 
then add 10 to it, you get 106, and that is precisely what is being 
displayed here not the typically first i guess that i did, 10 plus 12 
is 22 times 8 is 176.
# Simply if you put brackets is there and then tell me what you want.
Here the movement you put your brackets
n = (10+12)*8
print(n)                                 176
