## Opreations and expression 2
some more different type of operator.In python operator are 
divided into three major categories are:
1. Arithmatic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
let us start with arithmatic operators.As you can see we have
these many Airthmatic operators in Python.
# Arithmatic (+,-,*,/,//,%,**)
print('Adition',2+3)                          Adition 5
print('Subtraction',8-2)                  Subtraction 6
print('Multiplication',5*4)            Multiplication 20
print('Division',7/2)                      Division 3.5
# In a division operator we can use /and in a floor division we an use //.
let us first execute the code then we will se what is the difference 
between / and //. As you can see over here the output for division operator
was 3.5 is a fractional value and for floor division operator was 3 is a
integer value.
print('Floor Division' 7//2)                              3
# Next  airthmatic operators is modulus and Exponential.
print('modulus',7%2)                              1
print('exponential',7**2)                        49
In a division you can see over there the output is the quotient part in
a fractional value and in floor division operator the output is the quotient 
part in a integer value.
And in a modulus operator the output is the remainder after the division and in a
exponential operator first(6) raised to the power second(2) and the expected output
is 36.
## Relational operators (>,<,>=,<=,==,!=)
# > is greater than, < is less than, >= is greater than equal to,
# <= is less than equal to, == is equal to, != is not equal to
 
print(5>10)                                False
print(10>5)                                True
# 5 is not greater than 10 so the expected output in boolean value(False)
# 10 is greater than 5 so the expected output in bollean value (True) 
print(5<10)                                True
print(10<5)                                False
# what is difference between greater than and greater than equal too and similarly
# for less than and less than equal too, And double equal to and not equal to.
print(5>5)                                 False
print(5>=5)                                True
print(5<5)                                 False
print(5<=5)                                True
print(5==50)                               False
print(5==5)                                True
print(5!=50)                               True
print(5!=5)                                False

# Logical operators (and, or, not)
# let us explore them using python. First let us see the (and) operator print true and true,....
# In (and) operator both operent is to be true, if that case output is to be True otherwise is False
print(True and True)                       True         
print(True and False)                      False
print(False and True)                      False
print(False and False)                     False
# In (or)operator at least one operand to be true, if there is case output is True otherwise is False
print(True or True)                        True         
print(True or False)                       False
print(False or True)                       False
print(False or False)                      False
# not operator in first print is not essential we use True statement under the parenthesis.
# but in 2 nd print statement is not essential we do not use False statement under the parenthesis.
print(not(True))                           False
print(not False)                           True
