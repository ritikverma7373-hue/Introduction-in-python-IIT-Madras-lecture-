## Variables and literals
# we can merge the print and input statement how?
n=str(input('Type your name:')
p=str(input('Type your location:')
print('Hello',n,'how is the weather in',p,'?')
age=int(input('what is your age?')
print('Good to know you are',age,'years old')

which means same program executes perfectly with same 
messeges even though the values are changed how that happens?
There is something called as variable, for example, this n and p and age, 
all are variable; which means their values can be changed,

name = 'ritik'
name = 'sudarshan'
place = 'new york'
place = 'edinburgh'
age = 21
age = 40
In this case name, place and age are variables because they can be changed 
whereas, these names ritik, and places edinburgh, and ages 21 are refered as literal.
literals are actually values which are stored inside a varaible.
age = age+1
It means the value of age 21 add 1 to it and stored in a updated value in variable age 
but you cannot say 
30=30+1
beacause literals can be used right side of equal but variables can be used both side of equal
When to use variables and when do use literals
r = int(str('Enter a radius of the circle:'))
area = 3.14*r*r
print('Area of the circle with radius',r,'is',area)
we will use variable only when there is a possibility that the value which is being stored make change 
and when we are sure that the value is not going to change we will use literal
example: In a previous program the name is variable and place is variable and age is variable because it changed person to person and place to place
