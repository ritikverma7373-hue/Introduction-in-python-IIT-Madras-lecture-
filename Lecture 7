# Floating point representation of a number is the way a computer stores a number 
that is not an integer, A computer automatically recoginizes the type of data is being stored.
# why would anyone want something like this? The answer is very simple, if you were create a vessel
where you will put,let us say rice, look at the shape of jar,what kind of jar do you use for rice,
what kind of jar do you use for, let us say to store some liquid they appear differently is not just
for some aesthetics reason it is simply because because the hods rice is free from moisture whereas a 
contain thats tores water is not worry about moisture so it is very similiar way to kind of data  that 
you store, computer does some work internally and it to be stored in some memory location .Now it cannot 
keep the same location for all data types that may want to store.
#You need to know python has different data types.
l=[10,20,30]

print(l[1])                                         20
print(l[2])                                         30
