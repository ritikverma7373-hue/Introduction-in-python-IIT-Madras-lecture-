## A quick introduction to variables
 a = 10
 print(a)                      10
 a=a+1
 print(a)                      11
 a=a+1
 print(a)                      12
 a=a+1
 print(a)                      13
 a=a+1
 # let's play a one more command
 print("Enter a number:") 
 so what you should do is you should let your user , I mean, you enter anumber here.
 n=int(input()) after this program the cursor is waiting for you to put something
 this means please ask the person to input something convert thats to an integer
and assign it in n

 print(a)                      14                  
 # In this place (a) Alphabet is assign with variables 10 after this print a value is 10. 
   and then after print 11, 12, 13, 14
