## some more fun with variables and strings
In a previous program you can type number by the user in a print statement by using (int) function but if you type name then what are we doing now so we use (str) function
so what is str and what is int so we are discuss in a next upcoming lecture yeah.

print("Hello,type in your name:")
n=str(input())
print("Hello",n,"how are you?")
b=str(input())
print("Hello",a,"how is the weather in",b,"?")
print("what is your age?")
age=int(input())
print("good to know you are",age,"years old")
print("what is your favorite food?")
food=str(input())
print("what is your favorite color?")
color=str(input())
