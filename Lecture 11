## Introduction to strings 
s='coffee'
t='bread'
print(s)                                 coffee

print(s+t)                               coffeebread
# let us discussed when we print s plus t it will be concatenate, that is 
probly new word for all
# What will happen if i were simply say s of 0,even this we discussed, it will show the first letter of s, s of first letter of s, if I were to say s of 2 and so on.
print(s[0])                             c
print(s[1])                             0
# What will happen if you s of 1 here and then 3 here it does something else, it is starting from the first number and  does not goes up to 3, it goes 1 less, so s of 1 and s of 2 is (of).It is called String slicing.
print(s[1:3])                           of
print(s{1:5])                           offe 
print(s[3:5])                           fe
print(s+t)                              coffebread #concatenate two

# who is new in programming, I would expect this is to be 4 plus 7, 11. 
# that is because as you can see a here actually as a string,a is one 
# letter string, a character, b is another string  it should take this 
# string and place them one next to the other, the concatenation as and I 
# and I have telling you people computer does exactly what you instuct 
# the computer to do.
s='0123456789'
a=int(s[4])
b=int(s[7])
print(a+b)                                       11                   
# if you put int here then what is the output? I will remove int here 
 then what is the output? the output is 11.
